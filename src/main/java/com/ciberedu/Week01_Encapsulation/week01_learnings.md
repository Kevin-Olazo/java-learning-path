- The "Remote Control" Analogy
- - Think of the Book object as a television 📺 sitting in a room (Memory).

- - The Variable: The field Book[] borrowedBooks inside the Member is like a Remote Control.

- - The Reference: The remote control isn't the TV itself. It just "points" to the TV.
- If you have two remotes (one in the Library array and one in the Member array), they both point to the same TV. If the Member uses their remote to change the channel (or set isAvailable = false), the Library sees the change too!
